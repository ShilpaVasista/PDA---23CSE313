        "## Key Features of Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its simplicity and efficiency. Here are the main features that contribute to its popularity:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Python syntax is easy to learn and code. It is developer-friendly and is a high-level programming language.**\n",
        "2. **Like any other programming language, Python also allows branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.**\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Python has an effective data handling mechanism and excellent storage facility for numeric and textual data**\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Python has a dynamic and automatic memory management.**\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Python has a wide collection of operators and functions for data structures, such as list, tuple, and dictionary.**\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Python has large and integrated collection of tools for data manipulation, analysis, and processing.**\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Python code is interpreted by interpreter. This means that line-by-line interppretation is done for efficient programming. There is no need to compile it as in many other programming languages.**\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Python is a platform-independent programming language and hence runs on different platforms, such as Windows, Linux, Unix, Macintosh, etc.**\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Python is dynamically typed. This means that the type for a value is decided at runtime, not in advance. Hence, unlike any other programming language, we do not need to specify the type of variable while declaring it.**\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Python has an integrated suite of software facilities for graphical interpretation.**\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **The rich library of Python is immensely helpful in advanced algorithms related to different specializations.**\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **The machine learning algorithms of Python have brought a revolution in the field of Data Analytics.**\n",
        "\n",
        "These features make Python a powerful tool for various applications ranging from web development to data science and automation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Variables in Python\n",
        "A Python identifier is a name that is used to identify variables, functions, or any other user-defined item.\n",
        "## Characteristics of Python Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dynamic Typing**: Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning that you do not need to declare the type of a variable when you create it. The type is inferred from the value assigned to it, and it can change during execution. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "x = 10       # x is an integer\n",
        "x = \"Hello\"  # now x is a string\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Case Sensitivity**: Variable names in Python are case-sensitive. This means that `variable`, `Variable`, and `VARIABLE` would be considered three different variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Memory Allocation**: When a variable is created, memory is allocated for it based on the data type of the value assigned. The Python interpreter manages memory allocation automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Naming Rules for Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "When naming variables in Python, follow these rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n",
        "- They can contain letters, numbers (0-9), and underscores but cannot start with a number.\n",
        "- Variable names cannot include spaces or special characters (like @, #, $, etc.).\n",
        "- Reserved keywords (like `if`, `else`, `while`, etc.) cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of valid variable names:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "user_age = 20\n",
        "_userName = \"Alice\"\n",
        "score1 = 95\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of invalid variable names:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "1st_score = 50      # cannot start with a number\n",
        "user-name = \"Bob\"   # cannot use hyphen\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Types of Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "Python supports various built-in data types that variables can hold:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Numeric Types**: Integer values (e.g., `x = 10`)\n",
        "- **Text Type**: Strings (e.g., `name = \"Alice\"`)\n",
        "- **Sequence Types**: Ordered, mutable collections (e.g., `list = [1, 2, 3]`)\n",
        "- **Mapping Type**: Key-value pairs (e.g., `dictionary = {\"key\": \"value\"}`)\n",
        "- **Set Types**: Unordered collections of unique elements (e.g., `set_var = {1, 2, 3}`)\n",
        "- **Boolean Type**: Represents truth values (`True`, `False`)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Variable Scope\n",
        "\n",
        "Variables in Python have different scopes depending on where they are defined:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Global Variables**: Defined outside any function and accessible throughout the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "global_var = \"I am global\"\n",
        "\n",
        "def print_global():\n",
        "    print(global_var)\n",
        "\n",
        "print_global()  # Output: I am global\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Local Variables**: Defined within a function and only accessible inside that function.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def print_local():\n",
        "    local_var = \"I am local\"\n",
        "    print(local_var)\n",
        "\n",
        "print_local()\n",
        "# print(local_var) would raise an error since local_var is not accessible here.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Assigning Values to Variables**\n",
        "  -   An identifier is associated with an expression or a value.\n",
        "  - The = operator means assignment and does not represent mathematical equality.\n",
        "  - It should be noted that the numeric value is written without double quotes and a string value is enclosed in double quotes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Input and Output in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Input and output operations are fundamental in Python programming, allowing interaction with users and displaying information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Input in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary function for taking user input in Python is `input()`. This function reads a line from input, converts it to a string, and returns it.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Basic Input**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
        "print(\"Hello, \" + name)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "num = input(\"Enter the number:\")\n",
        "print(\"The number is: \", num, \"and class is: \",type(num))\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Type Conversion**: By default, `input()` returns data as a string. To convert this input into other data types:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))  # Converts input to an integer\n",
        "height = float(input(\"Enter your height: \"))  # Converts input to a float\n",
        "```\n",
        "  - **Python provides a distinct feature for taking input from the user using eval() function.**\n",
        "  - **This function considers the data type according to the nature of input provided.**\n",
        " ```python\n",
        "#Program to take input from te user using eval() function.\n",
        "val1 = eval(input('Enter the value of first variable:'))\n",
        "print('val =',val,'type: ',type(val))\n",
        "val2 = eval(input('Enter the value of second variable:'))\n",
        "print('val2 = ',val2,'type: ', type(val2))\n",
        "val3 = eval(input('Enter the value of third variable:'))\n",
        "print('val3 = ',val3,'type: ',type(val3))\n",
        "```\n",
        " - **In python, it is possible to give multiple inputs by the user using one single input statement. This helps in assigning multiple variables in one statement.**\n",
        " ```python\n",
        " #Program to show use of accepting multiple inputs using eval() function.\n",
        " a,b,c = eval(input('Enter three numbers: '))\n",
        " print(a, ' +',b,' +',c,' = ',a+b+c)\n",

        "print('Python World')\n",
        "```\n",
        "- **Print with \"end\" Argument**\n",
        "  - Sometimes it is convenient to view the output of a single line of printed text over several Python statements.\n",
        "  - Example: We may compute part of a complicated calculation, print an intermediate result, finish the calculation, and print the final answer with the output all appearing in one line of text.\n",
        "  - The end argument in print statement allows us to do so.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Print with \"sep\" Argument**\n",
        "  - The print() function uses a keyword named \"sep\" to specify the string to use insert between items.\n",
        "  - The value of \"sep\" argument allows us to control how the print() function visually separates the argument it displays.\n",
        "  - The name \"sep\" stands for separator.\n",
        "  - By default, the print() function places a single space in between the items it prints.\n",
        "  - The default value of \"sep\" is a blank string ' ', which is a string containing single space.\n",
        "```python\n",
